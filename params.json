Then, we added in the leading .NET library for XPATH2/XSLT2 support -- XmlPrime. Finally, it's being used daily to validate HITSP C32 v2.5 documents against the host of schematron files governing CDA XML. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe are grateful to Bohumir Zámečník @bzamecnik and the XRouter team for the ISO Schematron to start with.\r\nSemyon Chertkov @semyon was gracious enough to support work for the XPath2 only branch. \r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
